### smake

Make utility that can list the targets contained in 
the makefile.

### Features include

* Single target

* Silent commands/rules (prefixed with `@`)

* Multiple target dependencies

* Dry-run (show rules but don't execute them)

* Use `-c` to set target to `clean`

* Use `-v` to view defined variables

* Use `-l` to list all targets in makefile

### Notes

For now only one build target can be specified at a time.
